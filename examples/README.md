# Examples

`examples/basic/` is a small, intentionally generic dataset you can use to exercise the CLI without providing your own data.

Planned usage (once `cv build` is implemented):

- `uv run cv build --example basic`
- `uv run cv build --example basic --job examples/basic/jobs/backend_engineer.md`
